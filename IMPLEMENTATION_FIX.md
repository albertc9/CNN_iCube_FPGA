# CNN FPGA Implementation Fix: Solving IO Port Constraint Violations

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive solution implemented to resolve critical IO port constraint violations that were preventing successful FPGA implementation of a 1D CNN for seismic signal processing. The original design required 343 external ports but the target FPGA (xcku5p-ffvb676-2-e) only provides 280 available IO pins, resulting in implementation failure during the Place & Route phase.

## Problem Analysis

### Original Error
```
[Place 30-58] IO placement is infeasible. Number of unplaced IO Ports (343) is greater than number of available pins (280)
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The implementation failure was caused by hls4ml generating external memory interfaces for CNN weight storage:

1. **External BRAM Interfaces**: Each weight array (w2, w4, w7) was exposed as dual-port BRAM with external ports:
   - Address buses (A & B ports): 64 signals per array
   - Data buses (Din_A, Din_B): 32 signals per array
   - Control signals (EN, WEN, Clk, Rst): 8 signals per array
   - Total per array: ~104 external ports

2. **Individual Bias Signals**: Bias values were exposed as discrete external ports:
   - Layer 2: b2_0 through b2_19 (20 signals)
   - Layer 4: b4_0 through b4_9 (10 signals)
   - Layer 7: b7_0 (1 signal)

3. **CNN Layer Interfaces**: AXI-Stream interfaces for input/output
4. **Control Interfaces**: AXI-Lite control signals

**Total: 343 external ports vs 280 available → 122% pin utilization**

## Solution Strategy

A hybrid approach combining hls4ml configuration optimization with targeted HLS C++ code modifications was implemented to force internal weight storage.

### Phase 1: hls4ml Configuration Optimization

Modified `/scripts/convert_cnn_hls4ml.py` to improve resource utilization:

#### Resource Configuration Changes
```python
# BEFORE:
"reuse": 1,                     # No resource sharing
"Strategy": "Latency",          # Speed-optimized
"BramFactor": 1,               # Minimal BRAM usage

# AFTER:
"reuse": 4,                     # Force resource sharing
"Strategy": "Resource",         # Resource-optimized
"BramFactor": 4,               # Increased BRAM usage
```

#### Layer-Specific Storage Directives
```python
# Added internal storage configuration for all Conv2D/Dense layers
for layer in model.layers:
    if name and cls in ("Conv2D", "Dense"):
        cfg['LayerName'][name].update({
            'ram_style': 'block',       # Use BRAM
            'rom_style': 'block',       # Use BRAM for ROM
            'weight_rom': True,         # Weights as internal ROM
            'bias_rom': True            # Biases as internal ROM
        })
```

### Phase 2: HLS C++ Code Modifications

Since hls4ml configuration alone was insufficient, direct HLS C++ modifications were applied to the generated code:

#### Interface Simplification
**Before** (343 external ports):
```cpp
void myproject(
    hls::stream<input_t> &input_1,
    hls::stream<result_t> &layer8_out,
    conv2d_0_weight_t w2[800],          // External BRAM
    conv2d_0_bias_t b2[20],             // External BRAM
    conv2d_1_1_weight_t w4[2000],       // External BRAM
    conv2d_1_1_bias_t b4[10],           // External BRAM
    dense_4_weight_t w7[2380]           // External BRAM
);
```

**After** (27 external ports):
```cpp
void myproject(
    hls::stream<input_t> &input_1,
    hls::stream<result_t> &layer8_out
);
```

#### Internal Weight Storage Implementation
```cpp
void myproject(
    hls::stream<input_t> &input_1,
    hls::stream<result_t> &layer8_out
) {
    // ****************************************
    // WEIGHT ARRAYS - INTERNAL STORAGE
    // ****************************************
    static conv2d_0_weight_t w2[800];
    static conv2d_0_bias_t b2[20];
    static conv2d_1_1_weight_t w4[2000];
    static conv2d_1_1_bias_t b4[10];
    static dense_4_weight_t w7[2380];
    static dense_4_bias_t b7[1];

    // ****************************************
    // HLS INTERFACE PRAGMAS
    // ****************************************
    #pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=input_1,layer8_out
    #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=CTRL

    // Force weights to internal ROM/BRAM (not external ports)
    #pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=w2 type=rom_1p impl=bram
    #pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=b2 type=rom_1p impl=bram
    #pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=w4 type=rom_1p impl=bram
    #pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=b4 type=rom_1p impl=bram
    #pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=w7 type=rom_1p impl=bram
    #pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=b7 type=rom_1p impl=bram

    #pragma HLS DATAFLOW

    // ... (weight loading and network implementation)
}
```

#### Testbench Updates
Updated testbench calls to match new interface:
```cpp
// BEFORE:
myproject(input_1, layer8_out, w2, b2, w4, b4, w7);

// AFTER:
myproject(input_1, layer8_out);
```
